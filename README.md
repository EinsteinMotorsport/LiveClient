# TelemetryClient

## Installation
Make sure you've got Node.js installed: 
https://nodejs.org/en/

1. Install the npm packages (change your current-dir to the project-dir before!): `npm install`
2. Now you can run webpack to build the project: 
    * Production: 'npm run-script production'
    * Dev: 'npm run-script build' or 'npm run-script watch'  
      This will start a file-watcher to automatically build your project while editing
