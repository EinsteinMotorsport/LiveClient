# TelemetryClient

## Installation
Make sure you've got Node.js installed: 
https://nodejs.org/en/

1. Install grunt with npm global: `npm install -g grunt-cli`
2. Install the npm packages (change your current-dir to the project-dir before!): `npm install`
3. Now you can run grunt to build the project: 
    * Production: 'grunt production'
    * Dev: 'grunt' or 'grunt watch'  
      This will start a file-watcher to automatically build your project while editing
